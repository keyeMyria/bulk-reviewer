### Identify, review, and remove sensitive files.

Bulk Reviewer is a review and reporting application built in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/), [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). It scans directories and disk images for personally identifying information (PII) and other sensitive information using [bulk_extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor), a best-in-class digital forensics tool, and presents results in a review dashboard, enabling easy detection and dismissal of false positives.

Bulk Reviewer is intended to help librarians, archivists, and others to identify, review, and remove sensitive files in digital archives. Initial development occurred while the author, Tim Walsh, was a 2018 Summer Fellow at the [Library Innovation Lab](https://lil.law.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. The application is currently under active development, and is still in the exploratory/prototype phase.

See the project REAMDE on Github for development installation instructions.
